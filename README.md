# Project purpose:

This proects demonstrates how to set up a dynamic wesite which contains a searchable dictioary of coding items.

# Project Progress

AS at 14-08-2020 I have a rudimentary working version of the website, with some of the code files uploaded.

Note that for obvious reasns, the version of the conect.php files is a sample one (the one I have used on the local version I have of the site in XAMPP using the default uerbname and password) rather than the actual connect.php I use of the live website.

# How to files

I will be creating a series of 'How to' files to give you a walk though of hos I created this site.
